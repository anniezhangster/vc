# Philly Required Changes

First read the walkthrough [here](WALKTHROUGH.md).

## Changes

- All **internal** snapshots should go in the [Snapshots](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5YV7AKNT7yoVlNER3dscVZPdk0) folder. This is where DRFBot will look for them.
- Once someone has been assigned to a company that applied on the website, that person must be a member of the Trello card, and the card should be moved from 'Applied at Website' to 'Allocated Point Partner'. If you leave a card in 'Applied at Website', you will get spammed about it.
- Any cards in the 'Pitching' column must have a due date, indicating when the pitch will occur.
