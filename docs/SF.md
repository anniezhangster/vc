# SF Required Changes

First read the walkthrough [here](WALKTHROUGH.md).

## Changes

- All **internal** snapshots should go in the [Snapshots](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B5YV7AKNT7yoT1QycnluOHJFd0k) folder. This is where DRFBot will look for them.
- Once someone has been assigned to a company that applied on the website, that person must be a member of the Trello card, and the card should be moved from 'Applied at Website' to 'Allocated Point Partner'. If you leave a card in 'Applied at Website', you will get spammed about it.
- Once you have a date nailed down for a pitch, the card should go in the 'Scheduled to Pitch' column. Any cards in the 'Scheduled to Pitch' column must have a due date, indicating when the pitch will occur.
